# ExpoAstana
This app is intended to help tourists, visitors of the AstanaExpo2017 to get updatable schedule with the detailed information for each day, to learn and get the idea behind this Exposition, to look through history of the previous Expos in an easy to follow way. In the next version this app will have an indoor and outdoor maps, and may be the Google Street View feature for each Country for those did not came, and even for those who will attend this Expo to easily navigate accross huge attractions.
App is based and implemented with the help of the offline database, so, all data is already in app, with the exception of the images, which is loaded from the internet with the help of Glide Library, which has a Caching feature. Unfortunately, I haven't tested it with the real users yet, except my friends, who gave me some feedbacks. But as my main users will come in one year, when Exposition starts, I have a plenty of time to test it.
I'm going to upload it when real data comes, as all the data in the db right now is fake. But it will probably be free app, without any ads.
